## About
An unsold-food Reservation App

Leftover is an app that has a smooth user interface and functions as a Restaurant Food Reservation App, where we connect our users with unsold delicious food from a variety of stores and restaurants.

Unsold food can be found in the app and for each reservation made through the app will be sent as a request to the restaurants. Restaurants can find the request in the "Leftovers for Business" app and then accept or reject the reservation request. These reservation requests are easily sorted and arranged in the restaurant's app and can be viewed anytime.
